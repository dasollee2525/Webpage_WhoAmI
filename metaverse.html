      <h1>Beyond the hype: Metaverse</h1>
      <p>I major in System Management Engineering and Computer Science. <br>
         I mainly studied Data Analysis and AI fields and was preparing to get a job in the financial sector. <br>
         On my way to work at the bank's headquarter, I came up with a question.</p>
      <h2>Is this the life I wanted?</h2>
      <h3>Why couldn't I find what I like and what I want to devote my life to?</h3>
      <h3>How happy was your childhood? Did you step outside your comfort zone?</h3>
      <p>I hope kids can find their Spark and get outside thier comfort zone with bravery. <br>
         Like "The Hall of Everything" in the movie "Soul", <br>
         I want to implement a metaverse platform where children can explore jobs and dreams themselves. <br>
         It will be a heartfelt apology to my childhood and a gift I give to ones who will meet a new world.</p>
      <p>I am a member of XREAL, the metaverse association club. <br>
         We conduct lots of projects and networking for XR, AR, and Web 3. <br>
         It is amazing to know a new world by deep diving with people who have various dreams. <br>
         Metaverse can be a mirage or hyperbole, but when hype becomes a reality, people call it a paradigm.</p>
